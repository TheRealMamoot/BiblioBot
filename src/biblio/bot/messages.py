        📖 *How it works*
        --------------------------
        You can reserve your slot at *BICF* either for *later* or *instantly*:

        ⏳ If you choose *"I need a slot for later"*, your requested slot will be queued and the bot will attempt to make your reservation at the next reset time, which occurs at *:00* and *:30* minute marks.

        ⚡️ If you choose *"I need a slot for now"*, the bot will try to reserve your slot *immediately*. If the slot is not available, it will automatically be queued for the next reset time — just like the "later" option. This option is only for the current day.
        
        ❗ You do not need to book multiple times. If your original reservation time hasn't passed, the bot will retry automatically. The maximum number of retries for a request is *18*. Afterwards the request will be *terminated*.

        🔔 You will be notified when your reservation is made or if it eventually fails.

        📅 You can see all your reservations and their states by choosing *"Current reservations"*.

        🚫 You can also *cancel* your request. Doing this *without* the bot might cause issues with your next slot request.
        
        📌 *Reservation Statuses*
        --------------------------
        🔄 *Pending*: Your request is in the queue and will be processed at the next slot opening at :00 or :30.

        ✅ *Success*: Your reservation was successful. You can now go to the library — you can check your email to be sure.

        ⚠️ *Fail*: The reservation was unsuccessful but will be retried several times. You don't need to request again yet.

        ❌ *Terminated*: Your request has either expired, exceeded the retry limit or canceled by you. You'll need to make a new reservation.

        🛑 *Existing*: The bot has detected that you already have a reservation for this slot. It will not retry.

        ℹ️ You'll be notified if your reservation succeeds or fails permanently.
        
        💡 *Recommendation*
        --------------------------
        ❕ To increase your chances, it's highly recommended to use the *"I need a slot for later"* option and book in advance, before the day of your visit.

        ❕ Please avoid sharing the bot with a wide audience. Too many users may cause the system to slow down or fail, and it could reduce everyone's chances of getting a reservation.

        ❕ In case of any unforseen behaviour, please use /start to reset the bot. You can also use /help, /feedback and /agreemnt at any time.

        🏹 Happy hunting...for slots!!!
