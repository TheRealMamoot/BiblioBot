        üìñ *How it works*
        --------------------------
        You can reserve your slot at *BICF* either for *later* or *instantly*:

        ‚è≥ If you choose *"I need a slot for later"*, your requested slot will be queued and the bot will attempt to make your reservation at the next reset time, which occurs at *:00* and *:30* minute marks.

        ‚ö°Ô∏è If you choose *"I need a slot for now"*, the bot will try to reserve your slot *immediately*. If the slot is not available, it will automatically be queued for the next reset time ‚Äî just like the "later" option. This option is only for the current day.
        
        ‚ùó You do not need to book multiple times. If your original reservation time hasn't passed, the bot will retry automatically. The maximum number of retries for a request is *18*. Afterwards the request will be *terminated*.

        üîî You will be notified when your reservation is made or if it eventually fails.

        üìÖ You can see all your reservations and their states by choosing *"Current reservations"*.

        üö´ You can also *cancel* your request. Doing this *without* the bot might cause issues with your next slot request.
        
        üìå *Reservation Statuses*
        --------------------------
        üîÑ *Pending*: Your request is in the queue and will be processed at the next slot opening at :00 or :30.

        ‚úÖ *Success*: Your reservation was successful. You can now go to the library ‚Äî you can check your email to be sure.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è *Fail*: The reservation was unsuccessful but will be retried several times. You don't need to request again yet.

        ‚ùå *Terminated*: Your request has either expired, exceeded the retry limit or canceled by you. You'll need to make a new reservation.

        ‚ÑπÔ∏è You'll be notified if your reservation succeeds or fails permanently.
        
        üí° *Recommendation*
        --------------------------
        ‚ùï To increase your chances, it's highly recommended to use the *"I need a slot for later"* option and book in advance, before the day of your visit.

        ‚ùï Please avoid sharing the bot with a wide audience. Too many users may cause the system to slow down or fail, and it could reduce everyone's chances of getting a reservation.

        ‚ùï In case of any unforseen behaviour, please use /start to reset the bot. You can also use /help and /feedback at any time.

        üèπ Happy hunting...for slots!!!
